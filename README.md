<h3>Background</h3>

<h3>Script</h3>
<p align="justify"> The script will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
<ul>
<li>The ticker symbol.</li>
<li>Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</li>
<li>The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</li>
<li>The total stock volume of the stock.</li>
</p>
</ul>
<p align="justify">This script includes the code plus of the first challenge (summary of Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, Greatest Total Volume) for each year. The Stocks Challenge Script runs the calculations for all sheets in the dataset.</p>
